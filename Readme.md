# Openplanet Turbo

All the original Trackmania Turbo scripts bundled together for research purposes.

## Running

If you have the ability to run a custom menu script (you need a patched game), you can run these customized scripts in the game.

Put both folders (Media and Scripts) inside of `C:\Users\Username\Documents\TrackmaniaTurbo`. (You could also use `<GameFolder>\GameData`, but this has not been tested thoroughly.)
